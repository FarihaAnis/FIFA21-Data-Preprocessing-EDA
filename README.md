# FIFA21 Data Preprocessing & EDA
</div>

**Skills:** Python (Programming Language), Data Wrangling, Data Transformation, Data Visualization, Descriptive Statistics

---
**Situation:** </br>
The FIFA21 dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides comprehensive player information from the FIFA series soccer simulation video game released by Electronic Arts in October 2020. With data on 18,980 players and 77 attributes including player ID, age, nationality, club affiliation, and performance metrics, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for in-depth analysis. In this project, I will conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) focusing on various data types, address issues like missing data and outliers, and perform necessary data preprocessing steps to unlock valuable insights within the virtual soccer world of FIFA21.

**Task:** 
* Data Pre-processing: Responsible for cleaning and organizing the FIFA21 dataset, including removing unnecessary columns and preparing the data for analysis.
* EDA: Tasked with analyzing the dataset to uncover key patterns and insights.
* Data Discretization and Binning: Required to categorize continuous variables, such as age, into meaningful groups.
* Data Encoding: Assigned to convert categorical data into a numerical format for machine learning.

**Action:**
* Data Pre-processing: Conducted feature selection, handling outliers through capping, standardizing column names, filtering textual information, and converting specific columns to numerical formats.
* EDA: Created visualizations to explore relationships between player attributes and ratings.
* Data Discretization and Binning: Grouped ages into categories like "Youth," "Prime," and "Experienced."
* Data Encoding: Converted categories like "Preferred Foot" into numeric values to prepare the data for machine learning models.

**Results:** </br>
The outcome of this project was a well-organized FIFA21 dataset, optimized for further analysis. Through EDA, I revealed critical insights and patterns among player attributes. Notably, the visualizations, such as those shown in Figure 2—a distribution plot of player ages—and Figure 3, which illustrates the effect of capping outliers on player heights before and after the process, clarified distributions and correlations. These examples set the groundwork for advanced data analyses and predictive modeling, enhancing decision-making for player evaluations and team strategies.
